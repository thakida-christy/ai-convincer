# AI CONVINCING ART GENERATOR üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Future Unemployed


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Alan Joseph - Model Engingeering College, Thrikkakara

### Project Description
Our project helps users create an image using artificial intelligence. But with a twist. It doesnt give you the image as it is instead it gives you detailed instruction on how to create the image you requested.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There are general art tutorials but there arent tutorials that help people to draw what they want. By this project I expect to solve this problem that everyone has access to art.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Solution is AI, using AI we create ultra detailed steps for each lines and each strokes so that you recieve an image that you thought of rather than some generic ai generated pic
